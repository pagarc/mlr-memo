# Multiple Linear Regression Memo
Using R, I conducted a multiple OLS linear regression to see which factors affect anime movie scores on the [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) website.
I then communicated the statistically significant results in a memo-style report to a fictional consulting company. I also used SAS to replicate the regression results.
